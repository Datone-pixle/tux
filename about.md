<h3>About Surgeon Tux</h3>

Hi,<br>
I'm Lahiru Pathirage. Just wanted to share my blogging template with you. Its released under GPLv3,
so please feel free to do any modifications, edits and redistributions.

Heading font: [Post-no-bills by mooniak](https://github.com/mooniak/post-no-bills-font)<br>
Body font: [Hack by Chris Simpkins](https://github.com/chrissimpkins/Hack)

I tried my best to give `Surgeon Tux` a look of a root terminal. If you found it interesting,
please give it a [star](https://github.com/lpsandaruwan/surgeon-tux).
